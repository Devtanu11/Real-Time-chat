# Real Time Chat Application.

# working
In this Project, I am introducing to the development of real-time applications websockets using Node.js, Express and Socket.io with Vanilla JS on the frontend with a custom UI by building a real-time chat. Though the project will focus on this specific use-case.

To run this porgram first start your server on your local machine.Open the specific port on the browser where it is running.

After Joining our chatbot will show your name on server that you have joined. And can enjoy chatting with your friend who will online on that time.

After chatting you can leave chat your chat by clicking leave button. It will ask you yoyr confirmation after clicking yes you can easily leave chat.

And our chatbot will show to others users that you have left the chat.
